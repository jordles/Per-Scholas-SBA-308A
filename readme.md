## Process / What I Learned

I separated my js files into form, carousel, and the apis (anything related to promises and fetching); 
One of the things I learned from this assignment was how to hash passwords. SHA1 and and MD5 are not secure, but SHA256 still is according to standards. I utilized JS's native web crypto API to help me hash my passwords. 

## Requirements/Tracking

| Requirement | Weight | Finished |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your applicationâ€™s content and features. | 20% |  |
| Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data. | 15% |  |
| Enable user manipulation of data within the API through the use of POST, PUT, or PATCH requests. Ensure your chosen API supports this feature before beginning. | 15% |  |
| Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate. | 15% |  |
| Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary. | 3% |  |
| Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.). | 5% |  |
| Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS. | 5% |  |
| Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit). | 10% |  |
| Commit frequently to the git repository. | 5% |  |
| Include a README file that contains a description of your application. | 2% |  |
| Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience. | 5% |  |
